#### Features

**Text to Image**: Generate a high quality picture based on textual description. Use style cues with an accurate description to spin up a new image in a couple of seconds.
**Image/Sketch to Image**: Use a design or sketch or image + text description to generate a high quality image based off of original image. Adjust ```prompt_strength``` to alter the influence of original image on rendered image.
**Explore**: Browse image assets created by other users based on a variety of prompts and combination of styles.

#### How to Run
**Authentication**: Sign up using Figma or Google or create an account in Snappy.
From Quick Actions : Press ```‚åò + /``` to open Quick actions and search for ```snappy``` . Press ```tab``` and enter prompt to quickly generate an image onto your artboard.
**From Plugin UI**: Install the plugin from the menu and choose between methods of generating your custom image.

- For *freestyle generations*, enter prompt and hit generate, wait a couple of seconds for your image to populate the canvas. Customise the parameters for fine-tuning your output image.

- For *inspired generations*, upload/draw a sketch of what your generated image should look like, type in the prompt, adjust your prompt_strength and hit generate. Wait for a couple of seconds for the image to populate your canvas. The value of prompt_strength determines how further your generation will be from the original image.

**Prompt Engineering:**
The quality of your generation depends solely on the quality of your prompt. For best practices, refer to the ‚ÄúPrompt Guide‚Äù section of the plugin.
